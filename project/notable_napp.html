            This project is inspired by multiple TV shows such as
            <em>Thomas the Tank Engine and his Friends</em>, and
            <em>Young Sheldon</em>. The synchronous position monitor and
            interaction interface for toy trains we've created can tell users
            which segment of the track the two toy trains are at through the LCD
            screen of the FRDM-KL46Z board. There is also a user-interactive
            feature where users can push a button to fire a light-weight
            ping-pong that is set up on the body of a toy train and then later
            catch the ball with the same train. To make our train track scenario
            more realistic, we also feature a traffic light that would light up
            as the toy trains enter the train station.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our project can be further applied to more daily life scenarios,
            such as sensing the arrival of train in railway systems. Throughout
            the self-designed project, we obtained more hands-on experience on
            integration of electronics and polling, as well as GPIO
            configurations. We also learned more about how to design and
            breakdown a project.

          <h3>System Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Main feature is a user interface (displayed on the LCD pad of the
            board) where users can monitor the train positions at all times. We
            will use multiple hall sensors embedded on the train tracks to
            detect the trains' position. All the hall sensors/ train segments
            will be numbered, and the number of the hall sensor/train track
            which a train has just passed will be displayed on the LCD pad. In
            our code, we will use polling to retrieve the position of the
            trains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supplementary features include a coded “traffic light” (external
            hardware), placed at the entry of "train station" defined by us. The
            traffic light will light up when a train is about to enter the
            station, and will be turned off when the train has completely exited
            the region. We will also have a "tunnel", and the LED lights (on the
            board) will turn on/off when the train enters/ exits the tunnel. At
            the tunnel, we also want to include a ball-tossing game to the train
            which has two modes: automated and manually controlled by players,
            utilizing the button built in on the board. In automated mode, the
            train will toss the ball before entering the tunnel. The tunnel will
            be defined at a straight section of the track, so the ball will fall
            back to the train coach. In the manual mode, the player can control
            when they want to fire the ball, and the train may not be able to
            catch it.

          <h4>Position Monitor</h4>
          <p>
            Position monitor is the major component of our project: all other
            features build on it. To monitor the positions of our two trains, we
            used Hall Effect Sensors. Each track is labeled with a number (from
            1 to 17 counter-clockwise starting from the right of the terminal
            track) and has a hall sensor embedded in it (except for the terminal
            track). The magnets are glued to the bottom of the train heads, so
            they can pass by the hall sensors as close as possible and be best
            detected.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hall sensors are three-terminal devices. The ground terminals of
            all sensors are connected to the ground pin of our KL46Z board. The
            input terminals of all sensors are connected to the 5V output pin on
            the KL46Z board. The output terminals of all sensors are connected
            individually to GPIO pins on the board, which are set as input pins
            in our program. We also connected 4.7kΩ resistors between input and
            output terminals of the sensors to complete the circuit loop and to
            reduce the current to a safe level for our board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our program uses the idea of polling to read the inputs from these
            sensors. The sensor inputs are stored as global variables for other
            features to use. For our position monitor, we used the LCD screen on
            the board to display the current locations of two trains. The
            high-level idea for updating position uses hall sensor number it
            reads in, and compare the hall sensor position with train_1 and
            train_2 position to determine which train position to update. For
            example, we have train 1 at position 9 and train 2 at position 5.
            Now, when we read in a hall sensor position at 6, we know that we
            should update train 2's position by comparing the number with train
            positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use two functions to handle hall sensor polling:
            init_hs_polling() and hs_polling(). These two functions are very
            similar in the general idea for polling hall sensor position, and
            they are different that the init_hs_polling() is used to initialize
            train positions respectively, while the hs_polling() function is
            used to constantly update train positions. After position
            initialization at the very beginning, the code will mostly stay in
            the hs_polling() function. Besides updating positions, the
            hs_polling() function is also responsible to monitor track power
            control, ball firing, and traffic lights. These features will be
            discussed as follow.
          </p>

          <h4>Track Power control</h4>
          <p>
            We used the KL46Z board to control the train track, and thus
            starting and stopping the trains. The train set is designed in a way
            that the train tracks are directly powered, and the metal rails
            conduct the current to the motors in the train heads. Therefore, to
            start and stop the trains, we simply needed to power on/off the
            train tracks. Since we are running two trains on the track, a
            minimum of 5V power supply is needed to get both trains to desired
            speed. Again, our board's GPIO cannot meet this demand, so we used
            another motor driver to power the tracks. This driver is powered
            with only one 9V battery (two batteries also works but the train
            speed becomes crazy), and the logic input is again connected to our
            board.
          </p>
          <p>
            To set up the power button, we first configure a switch SW1 by
            finding the relevant GPIO pin, enabling clock for port, setting the
            direction of GPIO to input, enabling the pull-up resistor, and
            configuring IRQC. Then, we write helper functions
            operate_switch_polling_power() and power_toggle() that when the
            button is pressed, the power will be toggled. Finally,
            operate_switch_polling_power() is added to our hall sensor polling
            functions so that it can poll to check whether the power button is
            pressed. When the power button is pressed, both trains will start
            moving. Otherwise, trains will stop right away.
          </p>
          <h4>Ball Firer</h4>
          <p>
            We used a solenoid to launch a ping pong ball. Since the solenoid
            requires a large supply current, we cannot power it directly using
            one of the GPIO pins on the board. Instead, we connected the
            solenoid to a motor driver, which is powered by two 9V batteries.
            The logic input of the driver is then connected to an output pin of
            the board. When the driver's logic input is pulled to HIGH by the
            board's output, the driver turns on and powers the solenoid. To fire
            the ping pong ball, we set the output to 1, wait for 10000 clock
            cycles, then set the output to 0 again, so the solenoid quickly
            turns on and off.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used the LEDs on the board to indicate a good time for firing the
            ball. In order for the ball to be caught by the train, the ball
            should be fired when the train is at the straight sections of the
            track. On our track, this is from track 6 to track 9. We checked for
            the trains' positions stored as global variables to determine when
            to light the LEDs. When train_1 is anywhere between track 6 and 9,
            green LED lights up. Otherwise, red LED lights up.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two ball-firing modes that users can choose from. The
            first one is automatic firing setting that when train 1 passes track
            9, the ball will be automatically fired. The other one is manually
            controlled firer that users can press button to fire the ball. The
            ball firer button follows a similar set up process to the power
            button, except using a different switch pin. The solenoid is
            controlled to fire ball by setting the pin output to 1, then back to
            0. We write helper functions auto_ball_fire() for automatic firing
            that when train_1 == 9, then the ball will be fired by. We also
            write function for manual control operate_switch_polling_ball() that
            when button is pressed, the ball will be fired.
          </p>
          <h4>Traffic Light</h4>
          <p>
            The last small feature of our system is a traffic light model. The
            lights can be directly turned on/off by the board's GPIO pins, so no
            motor driver is needed this time. The traffic light turns on when a
            train approaches the terminal and turns off when there is no train
            in the terminal region. On our track, this region is defined from
            track 16 to track 2 (16-17-terminal-1-2). We check for the trains'
            positions stored as global variables to determine when to pull up
            the output. When either train's position is greater than 15 or less
            than 2, we light up the traffic light.
          </p>
          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p>
            The most challenging part of this project was debugging and
            coordinating the code and hardware. To debug the logic of the code,
            we would together talk through each branch of code and check that
            the values of each step were as expected by passing values to global
            variables and displaying the outputs. We also wrote separate test
            files to test the features individually, such as polling hall
            sensors and switch control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another approach we took for the probing between the code and
            circuit parts was by checking the voltage of circuit elements using
            DMM, to see if the parts were actually receiving or emitting high or
            low signals. For example, in a summary, to figure out why the
            solenoid was not firing the ping-pong ball when it was supposed to,
            we first checked if the corresponding hall sensor was updating the
            position of the toy train (checking for global variable in debug
            mode); then we checked the value output to the driver that
            controlled the solenoid (using DMM to measure the voltage drop
            between the output pin and GND pin); we also checked the wire
            connecting the solenoid and the driver was at the voltage desired
            (using DMM again to measure the voltage drop across the solenoid
            terminals).
          </p>
          <p>
            We also separately designed test cases for hall sensor detecting
            positions and switch behaviors to ensure that two of the most
            important portions of the project are functioning as we expected.
            For example, we wrote testing cases for switches by connecting the
            code to LEDs, and observe whether green and red LEDs light up
            properly when we press separate buttons. If LEDs are presenting
            accurate behaviors, we then connect the code to tracks and
            solenoids. The project was inspected thoroughly as we made any
            progress.
