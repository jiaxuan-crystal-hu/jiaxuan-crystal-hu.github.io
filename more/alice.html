            <em>Alice in Serendipity</em> is a paper craft design that responds
            to sound input, including the human voice or music. The project is
            inspired by <em>Alice In Wonderland</em> and the MV photo of
            <em>Serendipity</em> by Jimin of BTS.
          </p>
          <h3>Technical Details</h3>
          <p>
            The surface design is realized with flexible materials and embedded
            electronics operated by Micro-Python programming. The project
            includes the use of Circuit Playground Express (CPX), 11 LEDs, a
            toggle switch, and a potentiometer. Pulse Width Modulation is
            employed to adjust the output level from the actuators (LEDs). It is
            a stand-alone system that does not need to be connected to an
            external power source or computing device. The surface design of
            paper craft present unique aesthetic enhanced by ripple effects
            created by 4 groups of LEDs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design is enhanced by 4 groups of LED lights to create ripple
            effect that form layers and symbolize Alice walking into the cave.
            The LED lights built in cave layers also help to create silhouettes
            of vines, leaves, and trees. All the LED lights use cotton to
            diffuse the light ray to make it softer and create a serene
            atmosphere in the cave / forest. Another LED light built under the
            sun creates light rays emitted by the sun. The light ray also helps
            to create light on the ocean made of cellophane and plastic blue pvc
            materials.
